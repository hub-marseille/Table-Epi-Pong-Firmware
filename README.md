Maybe some day I'll make a proper readme, but nah, it's just my note pad when I need to write down some stuff for later


Game --> move paddles + ball
     +-> access controlls
     +-> access score (or screen class (not defined yet))
     +-> maybe access sound

paddles -> access motor class

ball -> access motor class

motor -> move motors and have limit switches
